== Introduction

There are several Garbage Collection algorithms available in Java.
You can find the supported JDKs in our 
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/requirements/#deployment-requirements-software[product requirements] section.

We will review some of the available GCs and their main features.

== G1

This is the default GC algorithm since Java 9. This is the one used for internal testing and used by default in neo4j.
It is available in every implementation.

== Shenandoah

It is officially available in some releases of OpenJDK since Java 8.

It is currently not available in Oracle JDK.

It allows you to have pauseless GCs (<10 ms) but at the expense of an higher CPU usage (20% additional CPU runtime usage).

WARNING: Please note that we do NOT test those algorithms therefore we will NOT be able to emit a recommendation.
Customers are free to test it on a lower environment and choose the one that suits them the best.

You can enable it by commenting the default `dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:+UseG1GC` and adding `dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:+UseShenandoahGC` in neo4j.conf 

[source,properties]

#dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:+UseG1GC

== C4 Azul

This version had its own proprietary pauseless algorithm which is supported.
This is a *paid* algorithm so you might need to get a licence first.
