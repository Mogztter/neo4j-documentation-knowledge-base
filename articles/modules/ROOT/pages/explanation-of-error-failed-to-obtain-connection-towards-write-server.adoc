In Neo4j 4.0, if you are logged into the `READ_REPLICA` of a Causal Cluster, and execute the following command to login into `cypher-shell`:

[source,shell]
----
$ $NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p mypwd
----

You will encounter this error:

....
Failed to obtain connection towards WRITE server. 
Known routing table is: Ttl 1589334991968, currentTime 1589334691977, 
routers AddressSet=[localhost:7637], writers AddressSet=[], 
readers AddressSet=[localhost:7637], database '<default database>'
....

NOTE: Before the 4.0 version, the above was a completely valid/correct command to log into the `cypher-shell`.

The reason is that the default value for the address (`-a`) parameter in the command is `neo4j://localhost:7687`.

The syntax is documented in the cypher-shell command-line help as:

[source,shell]
----
$ $NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -help
 -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                         address and port to connect to (default: neo4j://localhost:7687)
----

The implication of the default value `neo4j://localhost:7687` is that the `cypher-shell` is interpreting the login command as:

[source,shell]
----
$ $NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p mypwd -a neo4j://localhost:7687
----

WARNING: The above command is invalid/wrong. The `neo4j` URI scheme is the 4.0 equivalent of `bolt+routing`, and should only be used for connecting to one of the `CORE` servers in a Causal Cluster, not to any `READ REPLICA`.

To get around this error and logging into the `cypher-shell` of a `READ_REPLICA`, use the following command instead:

[source,shell]
----
$ $NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p mypwd -a bolt://localhost:7687
----

While connecting to a `READ REPLICA` from a different `Causal Cluster` member, use the command as:

[source,shell]
----
$ $NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p mypwd -a bolt://<read-replica-server-ip>:7687
----

IMPORTANT: A key takeaway from this article is that if youâ€™re using `neo4j` or `bolt+routing` URI scheme, you should be connecting to the `CORE` nodes in the `Causal Cluster`, not a `READ_REPLICA`.
